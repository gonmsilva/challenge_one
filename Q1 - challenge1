#b. What percentage of them are small? Hint: dt[,.(.N),by=column_name] will tell you how many rows in data table dt fulfill each column_name value

#c. How do they distribute in terms of location type i.e. transport, petrol station?

#There are 1103 machines in transport
#There are 16 machines at other places

#Products

#Transactional data

#f. Restricting the transactional data to March 2017, whatâ€™s the average daily items among small and big machines?
